# **Diabetic Retinopathy Detection using Deep Learning (CNN)**

In this project, we explore the capabilities of **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to detect **Diabetic Retinopathy (DR)** from retinal images. Diabetic Retinopathy is a diabetes-related eye disease that affects the blood vessels of the retina and can lead to blindness if left undiagnosed or untreated.

With the advent of deep learning, the diagnosis of such diseases has shifted toward the use of artificial intelligence, allowing for faster, more accurate, and more accessible medical assessments. This binary classification model is designed to distinguish between **two classes**:

1. **Class 0 (No Diabetic Retinopathy)**: Healthy retina images.
2. **Class 1 (Diabetic Retinopathy)**: Images indicating the presence of Diabetic Retinopathy.

The dataset used for this project is from [Kaggle: Diabetic Retinopathy 224x224 Gaussian Filtered](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sovitrath/diabetic-retinopathy-224x224-gaussian-filtered/data). It contains retinal images that have been **preprocessed** with Gaussian filters, resized to 224x224 pixels, and labeled for binary classification.
